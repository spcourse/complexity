# Complexity

In this assignment you'll learn all about efficient code and how to make your
own code more efficient. Specifically, we'll introduce the big *O* notation,
which can be used to describe how efficient some piece of code is, and we'll
cover some Python data structures that'll help make your code more efficient.

These data structures, like dictionaries and sets, can be very useful when
writing code in general, but they really shine when making code more efficient.
To highlight this, we'll also show an example of how code can be made more
efficient using these structures.

This modules consists of two main assignments: jaccard.py and word_index.py. The main focus in these assignments is on how to make your code run (much) more efficiently by cleverly using built-in python data structures.
